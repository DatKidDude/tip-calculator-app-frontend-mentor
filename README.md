## About The Project

In this challenge I will be building a responsive tip calculator in the browser.

Users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.

2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

3. Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Google Fonts
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- International API

## What I Learned

In this project I learned how to utilize the "this" value to manipulate DOM elements. To format the currency I used the Internationalization API. Lastly, I was trying to make my functions as reusable and robust as possible. Hence the use of the "this" value.

## Useful Resources

Figma - Paste the design image inside of figma to check containers, width, etc...

## Acknowledgments
