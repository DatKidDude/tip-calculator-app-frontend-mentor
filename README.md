## About The Project

In this challenge I will be building a responsive tip calculator in the browser.

Users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.

2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

3. Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Google Fonts
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

## What I Learned

Will update once project is complete.

## Useful Resources

Figma - Paste the design image inside of figma to check containers, width, etc...

## Acknowledgments
